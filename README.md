# Problem 1 Pass / Fail

**Input File:**  Prob01.in.txt

### Introduction

Students stress about their grades.  Itâ€™s only natural, because grades are important!  However, many universities offer the option to take certain classes as pass/fail.  Generally speaking, if you get a grade of 70 or above, you pass.  Otherwise, you fail.

Your job is to write a program to read in a list of grades and determine if the student earning that grade passed or failed the class.

### Program Input

The first line of the file `Prob01.in.txt` will contain a positive integer `T` denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:

A single integer grade, where `0 <= grade <= 100`

### Example Input:
```
6
0
48
69
70
87
100
```

Program Output
For each grade, your program should print `PASS` is the grade is 70 or above, and `FAIL` if it is not.

Example Output:
```
FAIL
FAIL
FAIL
PASS
PASS
PASS
```
